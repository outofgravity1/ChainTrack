## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials for the paper "Streamlining Blockchain Transactions: A Cost-Effective Pipeline for Enhanced Security and Integration in Non-Browser Applications". This project aims to improve transaction efficiency and security in blockchain applications outside of web browsers.

## Abstract
In the dynamic field of blockchain and Non-Fungible
Tokens (NFTs), our research tackles a notable gap: the integra-
tion challenges of blockchain-NFT transactions in non-browser
applications. In non-browser-based applications, users typically
necessitate additional steps to complete a blockchain transaction.
We introduce a bespoke pipeline, specifically designed for these
environments. Central to our approach is a user-centric multi-
device dashboard, which not only enhances security but also
significantly streamlines the userâ€™s transaction authentication ex-
perience. This is particularly salient in blockchain-based gaming,
our pipeline not only offers multi-application support, flexible
transaction signing, and cross-platform adaptability to enhance
efficiency and user engagement, but it also significantly reduces
blockchain transaction costs by implementing batch synchroniza-
tion, achieving a 90% reduction in gas fees when batching 10
transactions together. Our rigorously tested prototype under-
scores our commitment to fostering a more inclusive, secure,
and user-oriented digital asset ecosystem. This work represents a
stride towards realizing a user-friendly and economically robust
digital environment, enhancing the blockchain quality of service
beyond current limitations.

## Installation

The repository has multiple services used for the experimental usecase. 

- 2FA-Dashboard: This folder contains the React-based frontend for the ChainTrack dashboard. It uses JS and React. Please install npm to run this.
- 2FA-Demo-Client: This folder contains the Unity 3D client for the game-marketplace demo usecase.
- game-server: This folder contains the backend code for the game server written in Nodejs andd connected to MongoDb
- web3-backend: This is the backend code for a light implementation for the ChainTrack.
